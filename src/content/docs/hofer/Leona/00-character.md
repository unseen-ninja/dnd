## Personality Summary

- **Always Calm, Always Calculating**<br>
  Maybe she keeps a coin in her pocket she flips when making tough calls, but never shows her uncertainty out loud.

- **Tell Her She Can’t? Watch Her Do It**<br>
  Could get her into so much trouble in a fun way—make this her trigger for rash decisions. Tell her that fort’s impenetrable? She’s already planning a way in.

- **Freedom Above All**<br>
  She HATES cages—literal or metaphorical. Would go out of her way to free slaves, prisoners, or people bound by unjust contracts.

- **Internal Conflict: Guilt vs. Impulse**<br>
  She tries to walk the line between right and wrong, but the urge to steal, especially valuable or beautifully crafted things, is always there. She might justify it as “reclaiming” things from the rich, but when push comes to shove, that urge still wins out sometimes—and she hates that part of herself.
